ENHANCED_FORMATTING = {
    "Tax Planning": {
        "plain_english": "The process of organizing your finances to legally minimize taxes. It involves looking ahead at your financial decisions to reduce what you'll owe in taxes.",
        "case_study": "Robert, a small business owner, worked with a tax strategist to implement quarterly tax planning sessions. By timing his equipment purchases, retirement contributions, and income recognition strategically, he reduced his annual tax liability by $22,000 while maintaining the same business revenue.",
        "key_benefit": "Reduces overall tax burden through proactive strategy rather than reactive filing, often saving 10-30% compared to no planning approach."
    },
    "Strategic Tax Design": {
        "plain_english": "Creating a comprehensive tax strategy that considers your entire financial picture, not just individual deductions. It's about building a tax-efficient structure for your income, investments, and business activities.",
        "case_study": "Catherine, a technology executive earning $320K annually with stock options, implemented a strategic tax design that included entity structuring, investment timing, and charitable planning. This coordinated approach reduced her effective tax rate from 35% to 22%, saving $41,600 annually.",
        "key_benefit": "Creates a cohesive tax strategy that optimizes all financial decisions rather than isolated tactics, maximizing overall tax efficiency across your entire financial life."
    },
    "Forward-Looking Planning": {
        "plain_english": "Tax planning that focuses on future tax years rather than just the current one. It involves making decisions today that will reduce your taxes in coming years.",
        "case_study": "Michael, anticipating a business sale in two years, implemented forward-looking planning by establishing a specific entity structure and holding period. This advance preparation qualified his future sale for QSBS treatment, ultimately saving him $2.1M in capital gains taxes when the sale occurred.",
        "key_benefit": "Prevents missed opportunities by addressing tax strategies that require advance implementation, often saving significantly more than last-minute planning."
    },
    "Tax Timing Arbitrage": {
        "plain_english": "Taking advantage of different tax treatments based on when income is received or deductions are taken. It's about controlling when taxable events happen to minimize their impact.",
        "case_study": "Lisa, a consultant with flexible billing control, deferred $80,000 in December income to January, shifting it to the next tax year when she planned a sabbatical. This timing arbitrage moved the income from a 32% tax bracket to a 22% bracket, saving $8,000 in federal taxes.",
        "key_benefit": "Creates tax savings through strategic timing without changing the underlying economic activity, effectively paying less tax on the same income through timing control."
    },
    "Entity Planning": {
        "plain_english": "Choosing the right business structure (like LLC, S-Corp, or C-Corp) and using multiple entities strategically to optimize tax treatment and liability protection.",
        "case_study": "David's marketing agency was generating $450K in profits as a sole proprietorship. Through entity planning, he restructured as an S-Corporation with a separate real estate holding LLC, reducing his self-employment taxes by $18,700 annually while creating enhanced asset protection.",
        "key_benefit": "Optimizes both tax treatment and liability protection by creating the ideal business structure for your specific situation, often saving 15%+ on self-employment taxes alone."
    },
    "Effective Tax Rate": {
        "plain_english": "The percentage of your total income that you actually pay in taxes after all deductions, credits, and strategies. It's your true tax cost, not just your tax bracket.",
        "case_study": "James earned $250,000 but through strategic use of retirement contributions, real estate investments, and business deductions, he paid only $35,000 in total federal taxes. His effective tax rate was just 14%, despite being in the 32% marginal tax bracket.",
        "key_benefit": "Provides the true measure of tax strategy effectiveness, focusing on the percentage of income actually paid in taxes rather than theoretical tax brackets."
    },
    "Passive Loss Limitation": {
        "plain_english": "IRS rules that restrict your ability to use losses from passive investments (like rental properties) to offset active income (like your salary). These limitations can trap valuable tax deductions.",
        "case_study": "William had $40,000 in paper losses from his rental properties but couldn't use them against his $180,000 W-2 income due to passive loss limitations. After qualifying for Real Estate Professional Status, he unlocked these trapped losses, reducing his taxable income by $40,000 and saving $14,800 in taxes.",
        "key_benefit": "Understanding these limitations helps identify opportunities to activate trapped losses through strategic qualification for exceptions, potentially unlocking thousands in unusable deductions."
    },
    "Active vs Passive Income": {
        "plain_english": "The IRS classifies income as either active (from businesses you materially participate in) or passive (from investments where you don't materially participate). This classification affects how income is taxed and how losses can be used.",
        "case_study": "Nicole had both a consulting business (active income) and rental properties (passive income). By documenting 750+ hours in real estate activities, she converted her real estate from passive to active, allowing $35,000 in depreciation losses to offset her consulting income and saving $12,950 in taxes.",
        "key_benefit": "Transforms how the IRS treats your income sources, potentially allowing investment losses to offset ordinary income and creating significant tax savings through strategic activity management."
    },
    "IRS Time Test": {
        "plain_english": "The specific hour requirements you must meet to qualify for certain tax statuses, like spending 750+ hours and more than half your working time on real estate activities to qualify as a Real Estate Professional.",
        "case_study": "Eric, a technology professional, carefully tracked his real estate activities to meet the IRS Time Test for Real Estate Professional Status. By documenting 1,100 hours in property management (exceeding the 750-hour minimum and his 900 hours in W-2 work), he qualified to deduct $62,000 in real estate losses against his W-2 income.",
        "key_benefit": "Provides the specific qualification pathway for valuable tax statuses that can transform how your activities are taxed, potentially saving tens of thousands annually when requirements are met."
    },
    "Tax Bracket Management": {
        "plain_english": "Controlling when and how you recognize income to keep yourself in lower tax brackets. This involves spreading income across tax years or shifting income to family members in lower brackets.",
        "case_study": "Andrew, a business owner with flexible income control, limited his annual income to $170,000 to stay in the 24% federal bracket instead of taking $250,000 and hitting the 32% bracket. He directed the additional $80,000 to a corporate entity taxed at 21%, saving $8,800 in taxes through bracket management.",
        "key_benefit": "Reduces marginal tax rates by controlling income timing and recognition, often saving 8-15% on strategically managed income compared to unplanned income recognition."
